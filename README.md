## 🧠 About MedBuddy

**MedBuddy** is an AI-powered medication management app designed to assist elderly users and those with visual or cognitive impairments. It ensures safety, adherence, and independence in daily medication routines — even in offline conditions. This Flutter-based app leverages OCR, TTS, dose tracking, and an intuitive UI to prevent overdose and missed medications.

> 💡 Inspired by a real incident where my grandfather accidentally overdosed due to pill confusion — MedBuddy was born to prevent such risks for others.
